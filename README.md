### 4\. (Optional) Hide Navigation Bar If using material-you theme for ui 

If you want to hide the navigation bar without using material utils, follow these steps:

1.  Create a new file named `my-custom-styles.css` inside your `/config/www/` folder.
2.  Paste the following code into the file and save it:

    ```css
    html {
      --navbar-display: none !important;
    }
    ```

3.  In Home Assistant, go to **Settings > Dashboards**, open the top-right three-dot menu, and select **Resources**.
4.  Click **+ Add Resource** and enter the following:
    *   **URL**: `/local/my-custom-styles.css`
    *   **Resource Type**: `Stylesheet (CSS)`
5.  Click **Create**, then go to your dashboard and perform a hard refresh (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R).

## Kiosk Mode

This dashboard looks best on a kiosk (full-screen) mode suitable for wall/tablet displays. To enable kiosk functionality install the following integrations from HACS:

- `Kiosk Mode` (HACS)
- `browser_mod` (HACS)

The dashboard expects an `input_boolean` entity to act as the toggle for kiosk mode. Create an `input_boolean` in your Home Assistant Helpers section and name it `Kiosk Mode`.

Notes:

- Use `browser_mod` to target specific browsers/devices (if you want kiosk only on your tablet). See the `browser_mod` documentation for the correct service calls for your version.
